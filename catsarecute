    We love to hear our cats purr. There is nothing better than a cat curled up on your lap, satisfied and happy, but have you ever wondered just how cats purr and why they do it?<br>

<p>Humans smile, dogs wag their tails and cats purr. All of us show our contentment in different ways. So itâ€™s not surprising that when your cat is curled up beside you, or you are stroking them, they express their feelings by purring. However, purring is not always a sign of happiness.</p><p> Sometimes it is an emotional response, indicative of pain or distress. Indeed, cats may purr while giving birth, so purring is more likely to be a mechanism that helps cats rest and repair.

Purring may be feline self-comforting behaviour. It is first expressed when kittens are only a few days old, perhaps signalling their presence to their mother, encouraging her to feed them. This form of communication continues into their adult lives.</p>
<center><a name="top">to the top!</a></center>
<a name="howpurr"><h2><b>How do cats purr?</b></h2></a><br>
<p>What is most surprising is that cats have no special apparatus in their body to enable them to purr. Purring involves the rapid movement of the muscles of the larynx (voice box), combined with movement of the diaphragm (the muscle at the base of the chest cavity). The muscles move at around 20 to 30 times per second.</p> 

<p>As the cat breathes, air touches the vibrating muscles, producing a purr. Each catâ€™s purr is unique with some high pitched and others emitting a low rumble. Some purrs are so faint you have to be extremely close to your cat to hear it while others are extraordinarily loud.</p>

<h2><b>The purr and meow combination</b></h2><br>
<p>Cats have a special type of purr that they use when they want our attention, especially when they wish to be fed. This purr is known as a â€˜solicitation purrâ€™ and involves a combination of the purr and meow. Cat owners respond to this sound in a similar way that parentâ€™s respond to the cry of their baby.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful example of how our domesticated feline friends have evolved to live with and be nurtured by us.</p><br>

  <h6>the oldest cat:nutmeg!</h6>
  <p>The oldest cat in history was a feline called Creme Puff who was born on 3 August 1967 and lived until 6 August 2005 - an amazing 38 years and 3 days. Creme Puff lived with her owner, Jake Perry, in Austin, Texas, USA.</p><br>
  <h2>why do cats have fur</h2>
  <a name="fur"><p>A cat's fur prevents harmful UV rays from causing sunburn on a its skin. Well not quite, but the fur does tell a cat a lot about its surroundings. Similar to a cat's whiskers, the awn hairs help a cat's spatial awareness - hence cats rubbing their bodies against objects as they walk around.</p></a>

  <a name="food"><h2>what foods can't cats eat</h2></a><br>
  <p>
    <h4><b>1. alcohol</b></h4>Alcohol. As little as a tablespoon of alcohol can lead to problems for your cat. It can cause severe liver and brain damage.
    <h4><b>2.Chocolate</b></h4>Chocolate contains theobromine. While this bitter-tasting stimulant is found in all forms, itâ€™s most concentrated in dark and unsweetened chocolate. Ingestion can cause heart problems, muscle tremors, or seizures. Chocolate also contains caffeine.
    <h4><b>3.coffee,tea, and energy drinks.</b></h4>These contain caffeine â€” it can cause your cat to become restless, suffer from rapid breathing, heart palpitations and muscle tremors.
    <h4><b>4.cheese and milk.</b></h4>Perhaps surprisingly, dairy products are high on the list of what can cats not eat. This is because some cats are lactose intolerant so if they eat dairy products it can cause vomiting and diarrhoea.
    <h4><b>5.Fat trimmings, raw meat, raw eggs and raw fish</b></h4>Can cause vomiting, diarrhoea or a painful condition called pancreatitis (from excessive fat) and there is also a risk of Salmonella or E. coli associated with these foods.
    <h4><b>6.Grapes and raisins</b></h4>Dogs can suffer acute kidney failure from eating grapes or raisins â€” and although toxicity in cats is only anecdotal we would strongly advise that you keep these foods out of reach of your cat.
    <h4><b>7.Onions and garlic</b></h4>All members of the onion family can cause problems if eaten in sufficient quantity. A little bit of onion or garlic in some sauce is not likely to cause any problems. However, eating a clove of garlic or a green onion may cause digestive upset. Eating some type of onion on a regular basis could cause anemia.
    <h4><b>8.Xylitol</b></h4>This is a sweetener used in a lot of sugar-free foods, especially chewing gum. There are no records of cats becoming ill from this product, but in dogs it can cause a severe drop in blood sugar â€” which can cause seizures and convulsions or even death â€” followed by liver failure. Itâ€™s better to be safe and not let your cat eat foods that contain this ingredient. Click here for our full article on xylitol.
    <h4><b>Immediate care</b></h4>If you suspect your cat has eaten human food poisonous to cats try to determine how much he/she may have eaten and contact your vet for specific advice. In some cases, small quantities may not cause a problem but larger quantities may require urgent treatment.
    <h4><b>Prevention</b></h4>The best prevention is simply to keep your food out of reach of your cat. If you choose to give your cat human food, follow these guidelines:
    <ol>
      <li>The food should only be considered a treat and only given on the odd occasion to prevent gastrointestinal upset and nutritional imbalances</li>
      <li>If you wouldnâ€™t eat it, donâ€™t feed it to your cat. If you wouldnâ€™t eat the food raw, then your cat shouldnâ€™t either</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><b>Treatment</b></h4>Treatment is generally supportive until the symptoms resolve. This may involve hospitalisation, intravenous fluids (a drip) and blood tests to monitor organ function.

  <a name="cute"><h2><b>why are cats cute?</b></h2></a>
  <p>It's a big question, but someone has to answer it: Why do humans think cats are so cute?</p>
  <p>Granted, not everyone feels this way. Debates between "cat people" and "dog people" rage on. But there's no denying that cats are beloved by huge numbers of humans. Although some argue that dogs recently overtook cats in internet popularity, no one denies that cats were number one on the internet for years (and some argue that they still are).</p>
  <p>Dogs, as you may know, co-evolved with us humans over tens of thousands of years. Our co-evolution has yielded a unique bond between humans and dogs: We understand each other exceptionally well. The same is not true of cats, whom we definitely did not co-evolve with. Cats essentially decided to start hanging around humans when agriculture came to be, providing cats with a nonstop buffet of vermin. This relationship was mutually beneficial, but not exactly warm and fuzzy. So what is it about cats that we can't get enough of?</p>
  <p>Bryan Lufkin at Gizmodo argues that cats' relatively aloof behavior puts us in the intriguing position of voyeur. In stark contrast to dogs, who generally wear their hearts on their sleeves, cats rarely acknowledge the camera, and project an air of being unaffected by what's going on around them. Though this argument is centered around cats in photos and videos, the same concept may also extend to cats "in real life." Cats lead their own lives, and it's fun and cute to watch them go about their business. Plus, their unreadable faces make them the perfect blank canvas onto which we can project our human thoughts. Anthropomorphizing animals is the most fun pastime of all.</p>
  <p>Additionally, cats generally do not give out affection as easily as dogs, so when you do get a cat's affection, it might feel like a victory. That's not to say that cats can't be affectionate. John Bradshaw, feline researcher and author of the book Cat Sense, told Popular Science there's evidence that indicates cats really do show affection toward humans. "Superficially, [rubbing against humans] looks like scent marking," says Bradshaw. However, "the display that goes on when a cat raises its tail and rubs its sides against another cat, or a person, is a social action."</p>
  <p>Cats sometimes even have a favorite person or people to whom they show the most affection, giving these special few an extra reason to gloat.</p>
  <p>Okay, and there's a small chance your cat gave you toxoplasmosis, a parasite that makes you crazy about cats. But that's probably not it. Right? <i>Right?</i></p>

  <a name="feelings"><h2><b>how do you know what are cats really feeling</b></h2></a>
  <p>You'll learn a lot when you can interpret your cat's wide vocabulary of chirps and meows. They'll tell you when it's time to get up (at least in your cat's opinion), when they're feeling affectionate and if they're feeling threatened or are in pain.</p>
  <p><b>"meow"</b> is an all-purpose word. Your cat may be saying "meow" as a greeting ("Hey, how ya doin'?"), a command ("I want up, I want down, More food now"), an objection ("Touch me at your own risk") or an announcement ("Here's your mouse"). Some people have watched their cats walking around the house meowing to themselves.</p>
  <p><b>Chirps and trills</b> are how a mother cat tells their kittens to follow them. Aimed at you, it probably means your cat wants you to follow them, usually to their food bowl. If you have more than one cat, you'll often hear them converse with each other this way.</p>
  <p><b>Purring</b> is a sign of contentment (usually). Cats purr whenever they're happy, even while they're eating. Sometimes, however, a cat may purr when they're anxious or sick, using their purr to comfort themself, like a child sucking their thumb.</p>
  <p><b>Growling, hissing or spitting</b> indicate a cat who is annoyed, frightened, angry or aggressive. Leave this cat alone.</p>
  <p><b>A yowl or howl</b>l (they sound like loud, drawn-out meows) tells you your cat is in some kind of distressâ€”stuck in a closet, looking for you or in pain. Find your cat if they're making this noise. However, in unneutered and unspayed cats, these sounds are part of mating behavior (and very annoying). And if your cat is elderly, they may be suffering from a cognitive disorder (dementia) and may howl because they're disoriented.</p>
  <p><b>Chattering, chittering or twittering</b> are the noises your cat makes when they're sitting in the window watching birds or squirrels. Some experts think that this is an exaggeration of the "killing bite," when a cat grabs their prey by the neck and works their teeth through the bones to snap them.</p>

  <a name="cat,def"><h2><b>what is a cat in scientific terms?</b></h2></a>
  <p>The cat is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family. The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact.</p>

  <a name="milk"><h2><b>do cats like milk?</b></h2></a>
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2owMhhy8MsLxC/giphy.gif">
  <p>Like all species of animals, cats have been saddled with their fair share of stereotypes. As kids, we were taught to imagine that all felines could be found frolicking daintily through the house after an errant ball of yarn, losing their minds over some catnip, or politely lapping at a dish of perfectly white milk. There are some cats, I'm sure, who can't get enough of any or all of these activities, but is it really fair to assume that they're favorites of every feline? Having grown up with cats, I, for one, have never seen one drink milk. I always wondered if our cats were the exception or the rule. Out there in the rest of the world, do cats really drink milk? Or is this just one of many not-entirely-true assumptions that we've made about cat-kind?</p>
  <p>Before I go any further, I think it's important that we establish that there's tons of diversity within the feline world. Just like individual humans, individual cats are prone to have personal preferences and dislikes, so there's no way for us to truly confirm or deny that all cats have a thing (or not) for dairy. What we can determine, I think, is whether or not felines are prone to enjoying milk... and if it's even healthy for them.</p>
  <p>Vetstreet confirms that cats are, in fact, drawn to milk. Just as dogs get a little slobbery for bones and liver treats, kitties are usually interested in tasting a bowl of dairy. Our understanding of cats as universal milk lovers, however, actually stems from the extent to which they enjoy cream. According to CatTime, cats much prefer this variety of the beverage. Traditionally, families who kept cows would give the cream that rose to the top of the cows' milk to their cats, who were mostly in it for the fat. These days, most milk is so low in fat that it lacks some appeal for felines, anyway.</p>
  <p>The real question, perhaps, is whether or not cats even should indulge in milk. While conventional wisdom has taught us that it's a perfectly normal feline treat, the online veterinary community seems to disagree. Science Focus even lists "Milk makes an ideal food for cats" as the biggest cat-related myth out there! "The milk we now buy in supermarkets contains little fat, and while some cats may like it for its taste, many do not find it easy to digest," Dr. John Bradshaw notes in Science Focus.</p>
  <p>According to Dr. Bradshaw, cats are born able to digest lactose (the primary sugar in milk), but their ability erodes over time. After kittens are weaned, the enzyme lactase â€” which facilitates the easy digestion â€” starts disappearing from their systems. As a result, according to Science Focus, adult cats may experience upset stomachs after drinking milk or cream, since the undigested lactose can begin to ferment.</p>
  <p>If this sounds similar to your own experience with dairy, you're not entirely off-base. The process I just described in which lactose doesn't properly digest in a cat's gut is basically lactose intolerance. According to CatTime, most cats are actually lactose intolerant! This makes the whole cats-love-milk generalization especially hilarious, but also kind of dangerous, since it can cause a lot of pain and discomfort for our beloved furry friends.</p>
  <p>It's not exactly exciting, but water is the best and safest drink for cats, per CatTime. If your pet is really interested in milk, you can consider buying lactose-free milk for them at the grocery store, but your cat might not even be interested in it! Since cats are mostly interested in milk and cream's fat content, Lactaid probably won't be up their alley... but it won't make them sick either.</p>

  <a name="scraching"><h2><b>why do cats scratch furniture?</b><h2></a>
  <p><h5>They get to stretch out their bodies and extend and retract their nails. When they scratch, the movements help remove the outer nail sheaths. Cats also scratch to leave visual and olfactory (scent) markers. ... Some cats also may scratch furniture because they are not provided with adequate scratching posts.</h5></p>
  <a name="peeing"><b>why do cats pee on the floor</b></h2></a>
  <P>If inappropriate urination has become an issue with your cat, the most important thing you can do is make an appointment with your veterinarian. ... Urinary tract inflammation, diabetes, and kidney disease are just three of the common health issues that can make cats urinate outside of the litter box.</P>
